			<h2>Why Hire a ReadyEdgeGo Admissions Mentor?</h2>
				<p>Over the past several years, the college admissions process has become intensely competitive and complex. Admissions rates have fallen for the nation’s top schools over the past three years (see Key Statistics), and every school has a different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the college application is no longer about filling out forms. Everything a student does or doesn’t do in high school will be a factor during the application process in the 12th grade. As a result, many parents and students become overwhelmed, often times leading to frustration or worse - giving up.</p>
				<p>To relieve the pressure from parents’ shoulders, ReadyEdgeGo admissions mentors simplify the process by working with each student to chart out a comprehensive path to college. Our mentors provide guidance on everything from course selection and summer activities to study habits and motivation. Our admissions mentors have specialized knowledge of both private and public university applications, and by working with students individually, we have been able to consistently place students in the nation’s top 50 universities over the past five years.</p>
				</br>
			<h2>How are ReadyEdgeGo Admissions Mentors Different from High School Counselors?</h2>
				<p>Today’s average high school counselor manages a list of about 500 students. This makes it nearly impossible to provide the level of help needed by each student. Moreover, high school counselors don’t have the time or energy to learn the specialized knowledge necessary to help with college applications. High schools understand this fact and have mostly resorted to mandating the goal of maintaining graduation rates. As a result, average and above-average performing students are left on their own to deal with the rigorous demands of schoolwork, personal life, and college admissions.</p>
				<p>Unlike high school counselors, ReadyEdgeGo admissions mentors have only one goal in mind: to help your student reach his or her target schools. By scheduling consistent sessions and making themselves readily available via email and phone, our mentors foster a profound relationship with every student. We work with our students to develop a unique story that portrays outstanding academic performance, consistent engagement in non-academic interests, and clear goals for the future.</p>
