			<h2>Our Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>ReadyEdgeGo (the "Company") wants you to understand how we collect, protect, and use your personally identifiable information ("your information").</p>
			<h3>Online Information</h3>
			<p>Our goal is to provide an enjoyable online experience. When you access a Company website ("Company Site"), your information is protected by physical, procedural, and electronic safeguards. We will identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device. The IP address doesn't identify you personally, but it lets us identify the device you're using. We store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes.</p>
			<p>If you supply us with your email address, we may let you know by email about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the opportunity to tell us you don't want to receive future messages with each message you receive. If you email a question or comment to us, we will use your email address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your email address, your message and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations. When we collect your email address this way, we won't use it for marketing our products and services unless you have given us permission.</p>
			<p>Company Sites don't knowingly collect, maintain, or use information from children under age 13 unless first complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If we find out we have unknowingly collected such information we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible. We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose Websites may contain links to ours, including vendors where you may shop.</p>
			<p>Please note that when you shop with a vendor who is linked to a Company Site, even though you may have started your visit with us, and even though our pages may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with us. We don't share your information with them, but information you choose to share with them will fall under their privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We carefully select other organizations in an effort to give you the value and excellent customer service you expect from us, but we cannot guarantee your satisfaction with these organizations.</p>

					<li>We comply with federal and state regulations as well as industry standards set forth to protect your information.</li>
					<li>Companies that assist us in delivering our products and services are also required to protect your information and use it only for the services we ask them to perform.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Sharing Information with Affiliates</h3>
			<p>We may share your information with our affiliated companies in order to better understand your educational and financial needs and provide solutions. Unless you instruct us otherwise, our affiliates may selectively contact you about products, services, and promotions that may be of interest to you.</p>
			<h3>Sharing Information with Non-Affiliates</h3>
			<p>To the extent required or permitted by law, we may share your information with service providers and unaffiliated third parties for the following reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To service your account and provide you with products and services you have requested.</li>
					<li>To communicate with you about additional products, services, and special offers, using marketing providers to assist us.</li>
					<li>To comply with a legal requirement, such as a law, regulation, court order, subpoena, search warrant, or in the course of a legal proceeding.</li>
					<li>To respond to your opt-in request or other disclosure request.</li>
					<li>In the case of student loans, to report to a credit bureau, guaranty agency, school, or the U.S. Department of Education.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Steps to Take to Protect Your Privacy</h3>
			<p>The Company encourages its users to take the appropriate steps to ensure privacy. If you feel you have been targeted for identity theft, we recommend the following options:</p>
